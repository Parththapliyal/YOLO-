# 🚀 YOLO Object Detection Projects

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the training and application of YOLOv8 for object detection tasks.

## 📌 YOLO Model Training
- Implements a training pipeline using the YOLOv8 model (`yolov8n.pt`).
- Utilizes a custom dataset (`data.yaml`) for training.
- Configured for adjustable parameters like epochs and image size.
- Useful for understanding the fundamentals of YOLO model training.

## 🔍 YOLO Number Plate Detection
- Focuses on detecting vehicle number plates using YOLOv8.
- Loads a pre-trained model and fine-tunes it on a license plate dataset.
- Demonstrates model inference to extract and recognize plates from images.
- Can be extended for real-world applications like automated toll collection or parking management.



## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Ultralytics YOLO (`pip install ultralytics`)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy & Pandas (`pip install numpy pandas`)
